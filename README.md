# My little page

This is my page! Mainly, i will put here all my write ups from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, CTFs... that you can also find [here](https://github.com/anthares101/write-ups) but in an uglier way.

The page is published here: https://anthares101.com/

## How to deploy locally

Install the requirements:
```bash
pip3 install mkdocs-material
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can start the server from the project root directory:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
Now you should be able to see the server running in http://127.0.0.1:8000/
