# Paper

## Nmap scan

Time for the typical full ports basic Nmap scan and a more detailed one once we know what is open:

```bash

Looking at the open ports I think we can go for the webpage first.

## HTTP server

We are welcomed by an Apache test webpage, the thing is that Gobuster did not find anything. I tried Nikto to see if it finds something:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Paper]
└─$ nikto -host http://10.10.11.143/
- Nikto v2.1.6

+ Start Time:         2022-05-31 06:55:29 (GMT-4)

+ Uncommon header 'x-backend-server' found, with contents: office.paper
...
```

That uncommon header `office.paper` is interesting, I tried that as domain to see if there are virtual hosts in place and I was able to access a Wordpress application.

### Wordpress

The Wordpress version is 5.2.3 and I found this comment in one of the posts:

```
Michael, you should remove the secret content from your drafts ASAP, as they are not that secure as you think!
```

Researching a bit I stumbled with this: [https://0day.work/proof-of-concept-for-wordpress-5-2-3-viewing-unauthenticated-posts/](https://0day.work/proof-of-concept-for-wordpress-5-2-3-viewing-unauthenticated-posts/){:target="_blank"} which talk about a vulnerability in this Wordpress version that allows an attacker to get secret contents just by adding `?static=1` to the URL. This is the result:

```
...
# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.
...
```

Cool, we got another virtual host and also a way of registering to the chat application hosted there, let's add the domain to our `hosts` file and let's see how it goes.


### Rocket Chat

After registering a user we can explore this chat service a bit. Looks like there is a bot that let us get files from the system, in theory it only allow us to get file from inside a certain folder but is pretty easy to bypass using relative paths: `../something`. We can't inject command though.

Exploring the folder a bit I was able to leak the bot environment variables the with `../hubot/.env`. Inside that file we have credentials for the bot account: `recyclops:Queenofblad3s!23`, the problem is that the bot can't access the web interface and the API looks like is only reachable from localhost. The thing is... looking at the directory listing we see the user in the machine: `dwight` so maybe it likes to reuse passwords.

I tried `dwight:Queenofblad3s!23` as credentials for the SSH service and I got access!

## In the machine as dwight

To be honest this part was pretty fast. After some basic enumeration I launched Linpeas and immediately CVE-2021-3560 appeared as vector, I used this PoC: [https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation){:target="_blank"}:
